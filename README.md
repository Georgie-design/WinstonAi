## Installation

Clone the Repository and make a Virtual Enviorment. Put all the files into the Virtual Enviorment and download the nessasary packages with the ` pip install -r requirements.txt `.

## Note

This is my first repository and I am a ametur coder, so there might be sloppy unnessasary code that may or may note work.
